    <h2>SheepScheduler</h2>
    <p>A Java program which will generate a sheep shearing schedule based on a given file and priority scheduling. Only one sheep can be sheared at a time and the other sheep must wait to be sheared.

The next sheep to be sheared has the highest priority. <a href="https://github.com/nlauer07/SheepScheduler">View on GitHub</a></p>
